        <h2>Inventor</h2>
        <img src="inventor.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>
            An inverter converts the DC electricity from sources such as batteries or fuel cells to AC electricity. The electricity can be at any required voltage; in particular it can operate AC equipment designed for mains operation, or rectified to produce DC at any desired voltage.   
          
            The inventor's incoming voltage is 1500DC voltage.  The 1500V of active power in SMB is transferred to the Inventor through 300 sq mm (macro poly cab) cable.  The outcoming Inventor voltage is 1500 AC voltage.
   
               The plant capacity is 8MW.  This plant contains 6MW.  Each inventor produces 2MW. Aluminium Bustuck is used to minimise the loss.

        <h2>Bus duct</h2>
        <img src="bus.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>
          
The one Bus duct contains 3 RYB bases.  Therefore, the three inventors contain 9 RYB.  Finally the 9 RYB is converted into one. 

The 1500 voltage is converted into 690 and transferred to the transformer using bus duct.  The bus duct is connected in the LV side of the transformer

            It is mainly used in power distribution systems to step up or step down power voltage and transmitted over long distances. In the case of an inverter-duty transformer, it is built to handle high-frequency and high-voltage transmissions transmitted by inverters.
       <li>                        The LV side of the transformer is 690 voltage.  The HV side of the transformer is 33KB.  Transformer has 3 windings.  If RYB is short circuited,it will burst.  To avoid this mineral oil is used.  To analyse the temperature of the oil analog metre is used.   </li>

        <h2>Transmission Line</h2>
        <img src="transmission.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>Access to high-voltage transmission lines is key for the development of utility-scale solar power projects, as transmission lines are what move the power from where the electricity is generated to where it is consumed. A transmission line is the channel or medium through which the transmission and distribution of electric power occurs. It consists of a metal structure that acts as a support for electrical conductors through which energy is transmitted over long distances. Transmission lines can either be located overhead or underground. Overhead transmission lines are bare conductors above the ground level, supported by pylons and poles. The major parameter classifying overhead transmission lines is their length.</p>

        <h3>Four Pole Structure</h3>
        <p>Four pole main & tie breakers eliminate the need for complex ground fault systems. The neutral is not solidly tied to more than one grounding point, and is switched with the phase conductors by the four pole breakers.</p>

        <h3>Feeders</h3>
        <p>In solar power plants, the electricity that is generated by the solar panels is sent to the main substation through the use of feeders. The energy can either be fed into the grid or used locally after being stored at that location. The DC electricity is converted into AC power by the inverter, and the feeder then transports that power to the main substation. The feeders are often constructed using big cables or conductors that are able to transport a significant amount of electricity over considerable distances. Due to the fact that they are constructed to resist high voltages and currents, they are normally either put below ground or linked to existing power lines. Feeders are required to be used in solar power plants in order to ensure that the plants run dependably and effectively. They make it possible to gather and transmit solar energy from the arrays to the central substation, where it can either be utilized to satisfy the energy requirements of the community or transmitted into the electrical grid.</p>

        <h2>Module Mounting Structure</h2>
        <img src="mms.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>The Module Mounting Structure (MMS) designed for the proposed Solar PV Project is crafted to allow easy installation of Solar PV Modules. The structure is designed for simple mechanical and electrical installation, supporting SPV modules at a given orientation (8 degrees) to absorb and transfer mechanical loads to the ground efficiently. The installation of a number of MMS for a Solar PV Project is referred to as an Array.</p>

        <p>The array is designed to occupy minimal space without sacrificing the output from SPV panels while withstanding severe cyclonic storms with wind speeds up to a maximum of 150 km per hour. Nuts, bolts, and supporting structures, including Module Mounting Structures, must be adequately protected against the prevailing atmosphere and weather in the area.</p>

        <p>Before the installation of MMS, proper site survey (Topo & Contour Survey) needs to be completed for marking the piles for the legs of MMS.</p>

        <h3>MMS Foundation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mounting structure foundation is designed to fix the structure in such a way that the pile foundation of the MMS sustains the weight of the total module placed on a single array and wind velocity up to 150 km/hr.</li>
            <li>Pile of 300MM (12 inch) Diameter is taken by using DTH/Bore machine.</li>
            <li>Bore Width should be always the same throughout bore length. Bore length should be always straight in nature compared to ground level. This can be achieved by using a Spirit level indicator at DTH/Bore machine.</li>
            <li>Soil condition and Topography of the site affect the depth and width of the pile at various locations.</li>
            <li>Depth of the Pile can vary depending upon topo survey and ground condition at a specific portion.</li>
            <li>Pile Cap for each pile needs to be provided after the Column embedded into the Pile.</li>
            <li>Concrete Mixture used for the Foundation of MMS should confirm all IS standards. (M25 grade considered for this SPP).</li>
            <li>Proper compaction of the Concrete mixture should be done with the help of a mobile vibrator machine to avoid any honeycomb presence in the pile foundations.</li>
            <li>On a regular basis, Cube tests should be done for each and every major concrete load. Pull-out tests to be performed in different areas of the selected land to determine the strength of the Concrete material.</li>
            <li>The soil condition has to be taken care of during the design and construction of the foundation. The EPC contractor is responsible for the supply and execution of module foundation as per standard practice.</li>
            <li>Proper curing needs to be done for Pile and Pile caps during the construction phase of the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Control Room</h2>
        <p>The MCR room, the primary control room, should be at least 150-200 sq. m in size. It's essential to ensure that all areas of the control room building are well-designed and equipped with the necessary amenities to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the solar power plant.</p>

        <p>The Main Control Room shall consist of the SCADA, which is the software controlling the solar plant and reading of the equipment, Control Room, Battery/Auxiliary Room, and Administration Room. The entire building shall be provided with fire protection using a Cylinder (CO2) system.</p>

        <h3>Single Line Diagram</h3>
        <p>The complete Power Plant shall consist of one inverter station block with a 3.00 MW power station.</p>

        <p>The 690V AC output from Inverter terminals shall be further stepped up to 33 kV by Inverter Transformers located adjacent to the Inverter Rooms.</p>
